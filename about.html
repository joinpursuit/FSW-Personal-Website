                Hello my name is Joshua Mendez. I currently live in Hawthorne, NJ. 
                I was raised in Clifton, NJ. I attended Bergen Community College 
                for three years. It was there I took many different classes, but 
                ultimately decided on Computer Science. Unfortunately I was not 
                able to obtain a decree in it so I changed my major to general 
                liberal arts in order to graduate sooner. During my time in Bergen 
                Community College I also took part in some extra curricular activities 
                such as Student Government as well as, Student life. I was in Student 
                Government for 2 years. At my third year I was elected to become 
                Secretary of SGA.
