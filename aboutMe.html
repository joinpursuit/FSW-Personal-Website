    <p id="intro-description">My name is Carlos Hidalgo and if I were to describe my true potential and motivation in 7 seconds it would be: <b>"Growing up in Puerto Rico, there weren't many technological opportunities so I made it my mission to bring the future of coding to them."</b> On top of that I also enjoy photography, video games, as well as helping around my community. </p>
