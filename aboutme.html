        <p id="resume">  From dancing and creating art, to building applications and choreographing code; I am a dancer turned software developer aspiring to have a positive impact on the world using technology.

                I recently joined the <a id="pursuit" href="https://www.pursuit.org/" >Pursuit</a> core program, which is an intensive "<a id="fellow"><em>12 - month software engineering fellowship</em> </a>" , with a 9% acceptance rate.<br></br> As a creative, diligent, tech nerd, and sincere believer in the positive power of technology. My goal is to build and create programs that bring people in society closer together.
              
                My journey with <a id="pursuit" href="https://www.pursuit.org/" >Pursuit</a> will end in a year from now and after that I am hoping through my commitment and my persistence, I’ll achieve all my goals and also I’ll be able to give more to my community, not just as a person but also as a professional .
              
                <br></br>As a former performing artist I am passionate about <a id="instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/art_cuny/">art</a>, music and <a id="dance" href="https://youtu.be/rY_fkUZL2qI">dance</a> and even though I spend most of my time in front of the computer these days, I still perform, play drums and sing in my spare time.
