          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>Welcome! My name is Kenia and I really enjoy electronically communicating, like e-mailing or texting, but nothing beats an in-person conversation. I'm really interested in psychology and making a bunch of "observations" based on my interactions with people. Maybe this is why I am really interested in traveling and learning other languages, too - I want to see if my psychological "findings" transcend cultural barriers. Other than that, I am happy with myself - I take care of myself a lot and keep in motion, but I really love shopping and eating well, too. I believe I'm an A Class Sagittarius and that for the kind of person that I am, living in NYC is the best. :D</p>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <p>Today is your lucky day! In this section, I will answer what I think are the top 3 questions you may have about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where are you from?</li><p>I'm from the Boogie Down Bronx! Born and raised. Est. 1992</p>
        <li>What does your name mean?</li><p>According to google, my name means 'Greatest Champion.' I love that for me!</p>
        <li>Do you have any pets?</li><p>Yes, I do! I have a rabbit named Mochi. She's 4 years old and I believe that she is either a <a href="https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hulstlander-rabbit.jpg">Hulstlander Rabbit</a> or a <a href="https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/white-vienna-rabbit.jpg">White Vienna</a> (probably the former). I also have a betta fish named Data. I acquired them (not sure of Data's gender) from my previous roommate.</p>
        </ul>
          
        </div>
      
      <div class="textbox2">
          <div class="examples">
          <div class="example1">Sci-fi
          <p> Series like Cowboy Bebop, Futurama, and Ghost in the Shell set me up to be interested in the future of our society. I wonder what we'll look like in 100 years...  
      </p></div>
          <div class="example2">Numerology
          <p>I find it important to have a little faith. In what? I'm not too sure of that myself. Systems like Astrology and Numerology are comforting to me. Their openness to interpretation make them a fun "guide" for IRL situations.</p></div>
          <div class="example3">Illustration & Art
          <p> From an early age, I would channel my creativity in with a hands-on approach. It would not be hard to find me drawing in a corner somewhere. This is my favorite past-time next to my new hobby, coding.</p></div></div>
