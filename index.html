          I was born in the Dominican Republic in April 8, 1994. I'm a musician
          with over 10 years of experience and an aspiring software engineer.

          I came to the United States in 2015, and since then, I've been working
          to pursue my dreams.

          In 2017, I finished a music production and a music business course.
          And after that, I decided to work as a Uber driver, so I can have more
          flexibility with my schedule.

          Now, Uber give me the opprtunity to try and apply to be a Pursuit
          Fellow and I cannot be happier for that. I've tried to be in an
          program similar to this one and failed. It's time to do it right.
