    My love for problem-solving has led me on the path of a software web developer. As a selected Fellow at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate, I am currently honing my skills as a coder. In addition, my immersion into the tech industry world has shaped my perspective of how I can leverage my love of collaboration and problem-solving to real-world challenges.
    I am passionate about special education advocacy and accessibility of information and technology. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
    devices are a huge part of my daily life and I want to use this experience to contribute to the creation of more inclusive assistive technology that meet the communication needs of children and adults of all backgrounds.
