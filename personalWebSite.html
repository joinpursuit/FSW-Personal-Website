      I am a solutions-oriented full stack web developer, passionate about
      building products that solve real-world problems. My background in
      customer service has given me strong communication skills and a penchant
      for helping people, and has shown me firsthand the importance of creating
      platforms and systems that take into account customer needs. My projects
      pull from best practices in UI/UX and accessibility research to keep the
      user front and center and enable easy navigation. I thrive in work
      environments that have clear processes and where employees take ownership
      and pride in their work. Born and raised in NYC, and having spent X years
      in local government, I am particularly interested in projects that aim to
      improve city services or public education for New Yorkers.
