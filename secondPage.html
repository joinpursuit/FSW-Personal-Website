              just how time flies!!ðŸ˜¬ She was a newborn just yesterday. The way time
              can easily escape you in just a blink of an eye!
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides being a mom, which I must say, I think I'm finally getting the

              I enjoy learning! Yes I know a little odd. I enjoy learning fact, down
              to the littlest things to how things are made i.e. how is corn made
              into popcorn? (my most recent search lol). It's become so habitual
              that I really go by the " You learn something new everyday if you pay
              attention"- Ray LeBlond. Catch myself alot saying "wow you really do
              learn something new everyday.

              <li>I enjoy cooking and learning or making new dishes</li>

                Love to read!! favorite pass time(not much of atv person at all!).

                Teaching people or informing them of what I learned. Especially to
                my child.

              <li>Taking things apart and putting them back together.</li>

              Boy! Did I say a mouthful but i guess you get the gist. I really like
              to learn!! Always taking up a new project. I actually recently taught
              myself how to do my nails proffesionally. While being in quarantine. I
              was super excited. More so I get SAVE! SAVE! SAVE! ðŸ¤‘

              Let's reel the exciment back! besides as you must've notice that I get
              excited over the little things. I can be an overachiever which is not
              a good thing. Can be overly stressfull but I'm learning to manage.
              That also means I'm a hardworker. Overall I like to think I have my
              head on my shoulders. May be missing a screw or 2. But who isn't
              missing some right??

              I am a solutions-oriented full stack web developer, passionate about
              building products that solve real-world problems. My background in
              customer service has given me strong communication skills and a
              penchant for helping people, and has shown me firsthand the importance
              of creating platforms and systems that take into account customer
              needs. My projects pull from best practices in UI/UX and accessibility
              research to keep the user front and center and enable easy navigation.
              I thrive in work environments that have clear processes and where
              employees take ownership and pride in their work. Born in the
              Dominican Republic and raised in NYC, and having spent 4 years in
              local government, I am particularly interested in projects that aim to
              improve city services or public education for New Yorkers.
